# Optimal Voice Leading

## Introduction

Voice leading is the practice of connecting chords in a musical progression with minimal movement. In a simple chord progression, like C to F, the optimal triads in a voice-leading sense would be:

C: C E G

F: C F A

Notice how the upper voices (E and G) move to the nearest notes in the F chord (F and A), while the bottom voice (C) stays the same. This minimizes the total movement of the voices.

## Longer Chord Progressions

In a longer chord progression, finding the optimal voice leading becomes more complex. The goal is to find the globally optimal path through the progression, minimizing the total movement of the voices across all the chords.

To solve this problem, we can represent the possible triads as a directed graph, with each node representing a possible voicing of a chord, and each edge representing the movement between two voicings. We can then use Dijkstra's 
algorithm to find the shortest path through this graph, which corresponds to the optimal voice leading.

## Usage

Install the dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you want to play the generated MIDI from your terminal, you'll need to install FluidSynth:

```
brew install fluidsynth
```

You'll also need a soundfont file. You can download one from here: https://schristiancollins.com/generaluser.php

To initialize FluidSynth, run:

```
fluidsynth -a coreaudio -m coremidi /path/to/soundfont.sf2
```

If you want to generate PDF scores, you'll need to install MuseScore:

```
brew install musescore
```

## Examples

Here's a sample of the MIDI output for the "Giant Steps" chord progression. Note that chords are added behind the arpeggiated triads for context:
